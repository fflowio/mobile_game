# Help

A workshop for beginners, where you get to build your own flutter game.

We need your help! Please try it out and tell us what you think.

Here is more information about things you can help with.

Also, for design help, you don't need to run the workshop - unless you want to. 

Here's a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DWAhWEiNqZk) showing what you would build.

## Designs

The design work so far has been basic, and mostly done by a developer. Please suggest improvements
that will make this workshop more attractive and more fun!

### Images

The images were chosen from [storyset](https://storyset.com) because:

- they are free for commercial use
- they are multi-cultural

### Colours

The colours were chosen because:

- they work in dark mode

Everything is up for redesign: colours, images, layout.A

The code is slightly easier if you use standard flutter colours from
[this list](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Colors-class.html)

But, we can use hex colours if there's a good reason to.

### Layout

The layout was chosen somewhat randomly.

## Workshop instructions

If you have time, please run through the
[workshop instructions in the README](https://github.com/fflowio/mobile_game/)

Then let us know what you think! There are suggestions here for the kind of help we're looking
for.

### Mistakes

Please let us know about any mistakes in the instructions!

Also, due to constraints in Markdown, they are numbered by hand, so there's definitely potential for
numbering mistakes. Sorry!

### TODOs

We're working on the TODOs, if you see one and know the answer, please let us know!

### Context improvements

What do you think of the context explanations? Are they too long? Too short? In the wrong place?

### Age-appropriate

Is everything age-appropriate? A primary target for the workshop is teenagers, especially age 12-16.
Is there anything that needs to change with this in mind?

### Experience appropriate

This workshop is aimed at complete beginners. We're expecting some teenagers may have experience
with [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), but we don't assume it.

You're still welcome if you know more about coding in general, or about flutter specifically, but
you might find it slightly slow-paced. We'd still love your feedback!

Given that it's for beginners, would you change the pace or some of the explanations?

### How long did it take you?

Drop a comment in the discussion area that says:

- age category (under 12, 12 - 16, over 16)
- coding experience (none, a little, passion project hacker, professional dev)
- did you do the stretch goal? (no: ends at section 10, yes: ends at section 11)
- how long did the workshop take you

We've opened [polls](https://github.com/fflowio/mobile_game/discussions/categories/polls) for
these in the discussion section, to make it quick to respond!

### Animations

I'd love to add a stretch goal that creates animations on the finish page to celebrate. Can you 
help with this? Can it be done without an animation controller? Or can you explain an animation 
controller in a straightforward way?

## Setup

We plan to run this workshop in person, where the students will have machines already set up with
VSCode and/or Android Studio. That should be fine (or let us know if you think not...)

BUT, we'd also like people to be able to grab this workshop and take it themselves for self-study.
The workshop part might be ok, but the setup is definitely not beginner-friendly.

At the moment, self-study users are going to get stuck on
[these instructions](https://github.com/fflowio/mobile_game/blob/main/README_SETUP.md)

Do you have any instructions that you think are beginner-friendly? Especially for windows?
