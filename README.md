# mobile_game

You know how gen Z and gen alpha (and maybe the rest of us too) are attached to their phones. 
We use them a lot, for watching short and long movies, playing music, playing games... but
I don't hear new generations talk about a career related to phones, or if they do, it's about 
producing content.

I'd like to show everyone how you can build a mobile-ready app surprisingly quickly, and inspire
you to think about maybe doing more of this in future! It's not just coding, there are important 
roles, for example design visuals and story for a game. 

Read on to find a workshop for beginners, where you get to build your own flutter game.

If you think this game's a bit dull, what would you change to make it more exciting? What 
problem could you solve for someone in your family with a mobile app?

## About Flutter

Flutter is a programming language that runs... anywhere! But most importantly, you can run
it on your mobile phone.

In this workshop, we'll provide you with the scaffolding to write your first flutter app. 

# What are you looking for?

## New to coding

If you came here to learn to code, the workshop instructions are available at 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BsqEwFJYC2MtD4iQsAp1l_oDG3-OkwKoXOq7u9bFDAk/edit?usp=sharing

if you already have Android Studio ready to go, jump in!

If not, you'll need to run the setup instructions first.

## Setting up a computer to run this workshop

If you're setting up a laptop or desktop, you'll need to install Android Studio,
and clone the scaffolding code from github, ready for the workshop.

With apologies, setting up Android Studio with flutter is fairly complex. If you're a beginner,
you might find some of the instructions difficult to follow. If possible, find a friendly 
coder near you to help with this bit.
